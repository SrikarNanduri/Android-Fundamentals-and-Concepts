# Notification JobScheduler

Thisapp covers concepts of JobService, where we schedule a job to notify us with a notification when certain requirements are met. This app will demonstrate the JobScheduler framework by allowing the user to select constraints and schedule a job. When that job is executed, the app posts a notification. (In this app, the notification is effectively the "job.")
